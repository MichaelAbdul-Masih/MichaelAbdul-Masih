									<p> From the time that I started studying astronomy, I have always been passionate about sharing my love of the cosmos with others.
										My first real experiences with outreach came in the form of operating the public telescope at my undergraduate institution, where
									  I hosted telescope tours and showed visitors various astronomical objects from the roof of the science building.  </p>

										<h2>In person outreach</h2>

									<a class="image right"><img src="images/outreach_astronomy_on_tap.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> Since then, I have realized that I really love doing outreach where I can have conversations with individuals or small groups of people, and
										this has led me to seek out these types of events.  For example, I participated in a Speed Dating with a Scientist Valentine's Day
										event hosted through the Pint of Science team in Belgium, where I got to have 5 minute "science dates" with small groups of non-scientists.
										In these types of events, I find that the people I am talking with seem more relaxed and willing to ask the questions that they are too shy
										to ask in front of larger groups of people.
										Similarly, I participated in the Astronomia al Parque event organized by ESO where we brought posters and props to a park in Santiago
										in an effort to share some of the science being done at ESO with the general public.  This also happened to be my first forray into
										public outreach in Spanish!

									<!-- <p>	With SPAMMS not only can you model both components of binary systems simultaneously, but you can also directly account for
										rotational broadening without needing to convolve with a rotational kernel.  This is because when assigning the synthetic spectral
										line profiles across the surface, SPAMMS accounts for the individual radial velocity shift of each triangle across the surface.
										This removes several free parameters, and also allows you to accurately reproduce the rotational profile for asymetric stars
										like the components of an overcontact system.
									</p>

									<p> In addition, SPAMMS allows you to model many 3D effects that are impossible to reproduce using 1D codes.  For example, an
										important effect used to characterize the orbit of transiting exoplanets is the Rossiter-Mclaughlin effect. As the planet passes
										in front of the star, it blocks out some of the light from the star.  If the star is rotating, then the transiting planet may
										change the shape of the spectral line as it blocks different regions of the star, and thus change the measured radial velocity.
									</p>

										<h2>Outreach in VR</h2>

									<p> This effect is not limited to planetary transits.  In this case, we show a made up system where the primary is rapidly rotating
										and the secondary is contributing a negligible flux.  The face colors of the mesh are showing the radial velocities of each triangle
										with blue indicating blueshifted patches and red indicating redshifted patches.  As the secondary passes in front of the primary,
										we see the spectral line distort as the region of the star that contributes to that portion of the line are blocked.  This is just
										one of many interesting 3D effects that can be modelled with SPAMMS.
